#   2. repair .release-please-manifest.json when the pinned release-please
#      action's post-merge bump did not land — measured once, when 0.0.3
#      shipped and the manifest stayed at 0.0.2, making release-please
#      re-propose 0.0.3 against a tag that already existed.
#
# Debt #76 was the manual version of this: "At release time the hand-written
# heading is renamed from [Unreleased] to the version." The rename must land
# on main AFTER the release publishes — running it before would fold entries
# into a section whose release failed.
#
# Idempotent: when the heading is already folded (a re-tag of the same
# version), it exits 0 without touching anything.

# The race, and why this script checks for it.
#
# NOTE: this check is a snapshot taken when the PR opens, and it is not the
# gate. It fired correctly for v0.1.6, v0.1.7 and v0.2.0 and was still wrong by
# merge time in all three, because entries kept landing while the PR waited —
# which is exactly what it cannot see from here. scripts/fold-drift-check.sh
# re-runs the comparison against the prospective MERGE COMMIT in CI and is what
# actually refuses a misfiled fold. What follows is a courtesy warning in the
# PR body, useful because it names the drift early, and never sufficient.
#
# This runs at release time and opens a PR that merges LATER, when its checks
# go green. Anything merged into main in that window lands under the very
# [Unreleased] heading this rename is about to consume — so a fix that shipped
# in the NEXT version gets filed under the one that just went out. It is not
# hypothetical: v0.1.4's fold PR sat open while two PRs merged, and rebasing it
# swept both of their entries into "## v0.1.4 — in detail".
#
# The tag is the ground truth for what shipped, so compare against it. When the
# tree matches the tag, the fold is unambiguous and auto-merge is safe. When it
# does not, the fold still happens — the heading genuinely does belong to this
# release — but auto-merge is withheld and the PR says what was added since, so
# a human splits it rather than a script guessing which entry belongs where.
# The caller passes GITHUB_REF_NAME, which already carries the leading "v"
# ("v0.1.4") — the headings this script writes read "## v0.1.4 — in detail".
# Normalising rather than prefixing, so a caller that passes a bare "0.1.4"
# still resolves the right tag instead of looking up "vv0.1.4".
