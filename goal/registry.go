// Package goal names the Goals a build can score against.
//
// It exists because `--goal` was matched against a hardcoded `if`, and
// calibrating a Goal requires naming it. What it adds beyond a map is the
// containment described below.
//
// # The allowlist is a budget guard
//
// core.Goal.Score runs OUTSIDE the budget reservation. core/invoke.go brackets
// the agent call — Authorize, Invoke, Settle — and Score runs after the
// reservation has already settled, in both callers. That is harmless today
// only because the one Goal in the tree is arithmetic over two strings. The
// moment a Goal calls a provider inside Score, it spends money the guard never
// authorized and never settles, which is prime directive 4 verbatim.
//
// So registration is DEFAULT-DENY: a Goal registers only if its name appears
// in this package's compile-time allowlist of Goals that provably make no
// provider call. Absence is unsafe.
//
// The alternative — an affirmative marker method every Goal must implement —
// has the better ergonomics and is the weaker guard, because it is still a
// self-report. It catches the author who FORGOT and does nothing about the one
// who writes a marker returning true on a Goal that calls a provider: it
// compiles, and the tests go green. The allowlist takes the decision away from
// the Goal entirely and puts it in a one-line diff to this file, where a
// reviewer already knows what the line means. It is also mechanically coupled
// to the debt entry: adding a judged Goal REQUIRES editing the allowlist, and
// the trigger is written on the line being edited, so it cannot be missed by
// failing to read docs/debt.md.
//
// The cost, stated: an out-of-tree Goal cannot register at all. Accepted for
// v0.2 — Goals are in-tree today, the plugin boundary is Ring-2 adapters, and
// the plan that lands an out-of-tree Goal is the plan that fixes the budget
// seam, which is what removes this allowlist's reason to exist.
