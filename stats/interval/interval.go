// Package interval computes confidence intervals on paired differences.
//
// Prime directive 5: no reported delta without its interval. This package is
// where that promise is kept, so its failure modes matter more than its
// precision. Two of them are worse than a wide interval:
//
//   - A ZERO-WIDTH interval reads as certainty. knov1.Interval exists as a
//     message so that its ABSENCE cannot be mistaken for a tight one, and a
//     zero-width interval defeats that from the other side. Nothing here may
//     return one.
//   - A NaN bound renders as blank. An interval that renders as blank is worse
//     than one that says "we could not measure this", because a reader fills
//     the blank in themselves.
//
// The method is selected from a DECLARED property of the Goal, never from the
// data observed. Choosing an estimator by looking at the sample makes the
// confidence level hold only conditional on a branch that is itself a function
// of the data — and across many measurements some would land in each branch by
// luck, after which a consumer compares intervals with different coverage as
// though they were the same claim.
